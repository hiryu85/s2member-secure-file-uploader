A s2member add-on that allows you to upload a file to the s2member-files/ secure directory and automatically insert a link into your post.

== Description ==

You must have the [s2member Membership Plugin](http://www.websharks-inc.com/2496-3-3-13.html) installed and activated to use this plugin.

This simple plugin that allows you to upload a file to the s2member-files/ secure directory and automatically insert it into your post.

This plugin was requested by a client, who would only pay for 5 hours worth of work. The plugin could use some polishing and maybe some extra GUI love, but it does what the cliented wanted at the time. Because I feel like it could use some improvements, I'm releasing it as version 0.0.1.

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload `s2member-secure-file-uploader` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
